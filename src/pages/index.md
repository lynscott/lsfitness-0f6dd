          Once space is available you'll be sent a link to apply for the
          program. 


          The application is to designed to get a quick picture of your current
          fitness levels and what your goals are to make sure you'll benefit
          from training with me. 


          If no spots are available to sign-up you'll be placed on a waiting
          list, first come first serve.


          **To ensure a high quality experience for all, I only work with 10
          people at a time.**


          If everything checks out you'll be given access to the training app
          and I'll start preparing your program. 


          When it's ready we'll have our first meeting to get you familiar with
          the program, using the app, and answering any questions you might
          have.

          ###### This won't be your average, cookie cutter online program.


          Creating your program is only one part of the task, holding you
          accountable to execute is the real key to success. 


          You'll be able to message me anytime in the app with questions
          regarding your plan, exercises, lifting form or anything else with a
          2hr response time 8am to 6pm. 


          During our weekly meetings I'll get your feedback on how the program
          is going and how you feel. I'll make adjustments as needed as you
          progress.

          Towards the end of your program you'll be given the option to renew
          for another 3 months or end your subscription. 


          Full access to the platform will be revoked but you'll always be able
          to login and view a summary of your results or start again.

      - question: Do I need access to a gym for this program?
        answer: >-
          Nope! No gym membership required, we can adjust your plan to work with
          what equipment you have indoors or outdoors.

          Note: this does effect how difficult it might be to reach your goal,
          example, gaining lean muscle/strength will be much harder without
          weights.
